# rinf59

Small and partial replication of RINF data as a PostgreSQL database. Work in progress.

RINF is the European Register of Infrastructure kept by the European Railway Agency : see https://rinf.era.europa.eu/rinf/ 

This database is meant for testing applications using RINF, given that there is no publicly accessible API. Data are not supposed to be correct, complete, or up-to-date.
